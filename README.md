# GAME APP

This project consists of a little game app built using React. The app fetches games from an API using axios and displays them.

- In the app you can see a list of all the games, filter them by rating, click on a button to get more details of a specific game or delete the game.
- The app is both desktop and mobile friendly!!!
- The app was done in 3 hours as an exam for Wild Code School
